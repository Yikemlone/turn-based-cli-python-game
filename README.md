# Python game

**Summary**
A Python game inside the terminal. It is a turn based RPG style game, similar to pokemon, except a lot more basic.
This was my first major project with Python outside of making a madlibs program and a lot of testing syntax.

**Controls**
- 1/4: Select option
- ENTER: Confirm selection

**Music**
I made my own sounds and music for some of this game, but there are some sound effects and songs that I bought on Humble Bundle included.
